# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up 100 days of code on twitter and Github. I've also started up my webstie again, i've attempted to add a new navbar with bootstrap but didn't quite get it.

**Thoughts** I've been slacking on learning to code, even though i'm applying for front end jobs. So this is me waking up. Now i'm struggling with the first commit haha.

### Day 2: May 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on my personal website. Struggled again with bootstrap and looked back to previous work to compare. I think i'm starting to big with a almost finished version of a navbar and need to start smaller.

**Thoughts** It feels good to code, it's feeling like an old friend. Still lots to learn and get back to being comfortable with.
