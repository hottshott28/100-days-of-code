# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up 100 days of code on twitter and Github. I've also started up my webstie again, i've attempted to add a new navbar with bootstrap but didn't quite get it.

**Thoughts** I've been slacking on learning to code, even though i'm applying for front end jobs. So this is me waking up. Now i'm struggling with the first commit haha.

### Day 2: May 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on my personal website. Struggled again with bootstrap and looked back to previous work to compare. I think i'm starting to big with a almost finished version of a navbar and need to start smaller.

**Thoughts** It feels good to code, it's feeling like an old friend. Still lots to learn and get back to being comfortable with.

### Day 3: May 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I started back with some tutorial training on Javascript. Started a task list project. Set up another repo and pushed 2 files to it.

**Thoughts** Github is seeming less scary even after working with it for 3 days. This is good. V good.

### Day 4: May 22, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Rough rough rough, not much progress made. Tough to do on vacation and especially if i put it off until the end of the night. Followed the js tutorial and got kinda lost. UI is built but javascript doesn't execute properly, will figure out tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I need to prioritize to earlier in the day and focus more on why things are happening.

### Day 5: June 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the basics today. Went back to studying HTML and reviewing some interview questions.

**Thoughts** I need more time and more effort into this.

### Day 6: June 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Followed along the Javascipt Udemy course. Alot is going on but i'm getting the hang of it. Looked into new jobs and spend a good chunk of time coding today. chunk by chunk.

**Thoughts** increasing the time i'm putting in is earning confidence.
