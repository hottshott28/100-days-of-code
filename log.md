# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up 100 days of code on twitter and Github. I've also started up my webstie again, i've attempted to add a new navbar with bootstrap but didn't quite get it.

**Thoughts** I've been slacking on learning to code, even though i'm applying for front end jobs. So this is me waking up. Now i'm struggling with the first commit haha.
