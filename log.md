##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up 100 days of code on twitter and Github. I've also started up my webstie again, i've attempted to add a new navbar with bootstrap but didn't quite get it.

**Thoughts** I've been slacking on learning to code, even though i'm applying for front end jobs. So this is me waking up.
